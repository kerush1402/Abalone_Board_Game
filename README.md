# Abalone_Board_Game
Instructions

The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, with five marbles on each side. Each player has 14 marbles
that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown in Figure 1. For each move, a player moves a straight line of one,
two or three marbles of one color one space in one of six directions. The move can be either:
• broadside / arrow-like (parallel to the line of marbles) or
• in-line / in a line (serial in respect to the line of marbles).
A player can push their opponent's marbles if they are in a line to their own using an in-line move only. They can only push if
the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push one or two; two can push one). Marbles must be
pushed to either:
• an empty space (i.e. not blocked by a marble) or
• off the board.
The winner is the first player to push six of the opponent's marbles off of the edge of the board.
